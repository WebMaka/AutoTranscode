#
# IMPORTANT NOTES:
#
# 1. Settings in this file override command-line arguments. If a source directory
#    is provided here, the script will ignore one provided in the command line.
# 2. A transcode preset MUST be specified in the command line UNLESS BOTH a
#    custom ffmpeg command line AND a container are specified in this file.
# 3. Any entry can be left out of this configuration file and instead provided 
#    via command line argument. "Left out" can mean that the relevant entry is
#    left blank, e.g., "finished=" or commented out, e.g., "#finished=<foo>".
